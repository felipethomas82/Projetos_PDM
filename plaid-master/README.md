*Design news and inspiration.*

Plaid is a showcase of [material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/) that we hope you will
keep installed. It pulls in news & inspiration from [Designer News](https://www.designernews.co/),
[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) & [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). It demonstrates
the use of
[material principles](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-principles)
to create tactile, bold, understandable UIs.

**[Install on Google Play (Beta Testing)](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.plaidapp)**
